# PixelPass
Secure, reproducable, password generation from lossless image files

Password generation with PixelPass is a 3 step process.

1: Choose the initial master image that will be used to modifying values when generating a password.

2: Select the image you would like to use as a key with this master file for password generation.

3: Enter your desired password length.


The tool will let you know how long your password can be according to the deminsions of your chosen image.
More updates will come. The next step in the development process is creating a GUI for simpler file selection.
